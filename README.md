This is Asp.NET Car shop project. I used visual studio 2019 to build this. This project is based on MVC architecture. I used the Gerahost To host the host the website. Georhost database is online. You can find the username and password under appsetting.json file.

I have added thee API which links are mention below. API returns json data.

https://localhost:44330/api/cars/ - will return the all json data which is available.

https://localhost:44330/api/cars/1 - will return JSON data which has id =1

This Project also included Unit tester which test the HomeController functionality.
